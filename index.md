## Welcome!

Hi and welcome to my website, my name is Matt, I'm a programmer with an appreciation for minimalism, design and simplicity. I'm currently investing my spare time into learning the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

### Open Source

I'm a big advocate for open source software, in fact, the page you're reading right now was built with an open source static site generator called [Cobalt](http://cobalt-org.github.io), I wrote the templates and content using visual studio code on the linux operating system, you can even read the full source code on [github!](https://github.com/StreatCodes/streat.io) I was also lucky enough to attend [linux.conf.au](https://linux.conf.au/) a conference all about linux and open source software in 2018 and 2019 which was really inspiring and I'll definitely be attending next year.
